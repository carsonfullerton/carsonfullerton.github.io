### Some Projects for CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a fun and simple Guess-the-Number game. We were tasked to write two files; one of which would take user-input to create a password, while the other would allow the user to guess said password. We used ofstream to output to a file such that we could store the value and ifstream to interpret the data in the file.

* Lab 10

    I enjoyed Lab 10 quite a lot. We worked with 2D Vectors for the first time, which I'd enjoyed. Our goal was to transcribe data for the populations of counties in California. My partner and I very quickly got through the work, and it was nice to learn about applications of 2D Vectors.

* Lab 11

    I liked Lab 11 because it served as a bit of a challenge for me. In part 1, we were to iterate through CSV data to determine the densest and sparsest state based on population. Prior to this, I'd yet to work with CSV files, so I was a bit lost on how to approach the task at first.
